In [part three]({filename}/field_notes/xkcd_font_pt3.md) of my XKCD font saga I generated several hundred glyphs as PPM images, and
classified them with their associated character(s). In this instalment, I will convert the raster glyphs into vector form (SVG) and then
generate a rudimentary font using FontForge.

I make no apologies for the amount of code here - I've tidied it up a little, but it is representative of the journey I have taken to produce
a fully functional XKCD font. If you just want to see the resulting font you can scroll about three-quarters of the way down the page to 
[play with the final font in your browser](#font-final).
