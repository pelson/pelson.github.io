In [part two]({filename}/field_notes/xkcd_font_pt2.md) of my XKCD font saga I was able to separate strokes from the XKCD
handwriting dataset into many smaller images. I also handled the easier cases of merging some of the strokes back together - I particularly
focused on "dotty" or "liney" type glyphs, such as i, !, % and =.

Now I want to attribute a Unicode character to my segmented images, so that I can subsequently generate a font-file. 
We are well and truly in the domain of optical character recognition (OCR) here, but because I want absolute control of the results
(and 100% accuracy) I'm going to take the simple approach of mapping glyph positions to characters myself.

As a reminder, here is a down-sampled version the XKCD handwriting file:

## Conclusion

In this edition, I merged the few remaining strokes together to produce the finished glyphs, and classified each of the glyphs with associated
characters (mostly Unicode). I then saved these rasters out to a semantic filename in the PPM format. Next up, convert the rasters to vector SVGs
so that we can import them into our font tool programmatically.
